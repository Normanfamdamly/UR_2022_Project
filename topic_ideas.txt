Topic ideas:

- NCAA conference alignment optimization
- Mental health care access (geographic? insurance coverage? demographics? neighborhoods/maps?)
- Currency fluctuations (seems difficult - they all change relative to each other, not an absolute standard) BUT we could compare official currency to crypto
- Gas prices - what drives them?
