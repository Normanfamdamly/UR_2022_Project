Topic ideas:

- NCAA conference alignment optimization OR... do NILs matter for recruitment?
- Mental health care access (geographic? insurance coverage? demographics? neighborhoods/maps?)
- Availability/ease of voting
- Currency fluctuations (seems difficult - they all change relative to each other, not an absolute standard) BUT we could compare official currency to crypto
- Gas prices - what drives them? Across time OR across geographic locations?

How to decide:
- What's within the scope of what we know about machine learning?

- Where can we get data?
	- Healthcare APIs exist and are reliable
	- NCAA stuff likely involves heavy webscraping
	- Ann-Marie has access to currency data (might need cleaning)
	- Gas prices can be web searched

-Where is the narrative able to be moved forward? What's current in the world?
	- What even is "optimal" for conferences? If we don't know the target variable, what are we analyzing?
	- Gas prices factors seem fairly understood by economists
	- Mental health: lots of "we need to do better", but a lot of room to improve on actually doing better!
		--Multi factor: income, race, cultural factors, neighborhood, indoor/outdoor work. Idea: Let's have ML decide what the components are!


- If we go with mental health, the project could be...
	- Categorization of patients into risk categories (via ML)
	- Analysis of which groups have easy/affordable access to care (via map API)
	-

Main questions:
What is a specific topic we would like to focus out data on
(demographics: race, financial, age)

Key points:
	- level of access to care based on demographics listed above
